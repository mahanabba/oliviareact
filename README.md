Simple survey mobile application written in react native to assess risk for catching covid 19.


This version of the application is only a demo template and fetches survey results to upload to a firebase instance, configuration information for the instance can be changed to use with your own. 

Survey questions/answers can be easily changed by editing the survey variable in Screens/SurveyScreen.js, for more information visit the documentation for react native simple survey (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-simple-survey).
